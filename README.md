## 📜 About Project

> 42 School Minishell project is a simple shell program that mimics the behavior of a Unix shell. \
> The project is designed to introduce the basics of shell scripting and command execution.

For detailed information, refer to the [**subject of this project**](en.subject.pdf).

	🚀 TLDR: This project is an introduction to the basics of shell scripting and command execution.
    Learn about parsing commands, handling built-in functions, and managing processes.

> [!NOTE]  
> Because of 42 School norm requirements:
> * Each function can't have more than 25 lines of code.
> * All variables are declared and aligned at the top of each function.
> * Project should be created just with allowed functions otherwise it's cheating.

* The shell must handle redirections (`<`, `>`, `>>`) and pipes (`|`).
* The shell must manage environment variables.
